piplug
======

PiPlug provides an extensible front-end for the Raspberry Pi allowing small Java plug-ins to be written using Eclipse SWT (very small overhead -- no full Eclipse footprint).  The PiPlug runtime allows configuration of a remote URL to access a list of plug-ins from and will dynamically ensure that those plug-ins are up and running.
