PiPlug provides an extensible front-end for the Raspberry Pi allowing small Java plug-ins to be written using Eclipse SWT (very small overhead -- no full Eclipse footprint).  The PiPlug runtime connects to a PiPlug daemon that services apps on your local network, with automatic discovery.  A plug-in for Eclipse gives you a simple view to upload your apps dynamically to the daemon with them automatically becoming available.

To Get Started
--------------

Follow the simple instructions or watch a recent presentation of PiPlug at http://genuitec.github.io/piplug/ to quickly get up to speed.  You can use Issues on GitHub, or the Disqus conversation area on the GitHub Pages area.

Enjoy and we look forward to you dropping in to say hi!
